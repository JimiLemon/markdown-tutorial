# Exercises

## Part 1

Make a markdown file of the following tutorial: [HPC Logging in](https://asti.dost.gov.ph/coare/wiki/Main/using-coare/hpc/logging-in)

Additional notes:

- No hot linking. Download the assets (images, etc.) locally. Save them inside the images folder.
- Make sure to use sensible filenames to the images.
- Give alt text to images.
- Include a table of contents.

## Part 2

Recreate the following:

> This is a paragraph.
> First line.  
> Next line.  
> Third line.  
> There should be no extra spacing between each line.  
> _**This line is both italic and bold!**_
>
> There is a blank space above.  
> This <sub>line</sub> of <sup>text</sup> is <sub>wavy.</sub>

My favorite equation is:

$$ \frac{}{} $$

## Part 3

Create a task list showing that you accomplished this exercise.
Link by reference your solutions for each task. Also, place your names below the file. Your names should be a link that when clicked, will redirect you to your email. Sample: [Imari Joy C. Borda](mailto:icborda@up.edu.ph)
